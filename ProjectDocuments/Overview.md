# Aether Hand

**Aether Hand** is a collectible card game set in a near-future, high-fantasy world. 

In this world there exist a select few who possess the so called "Aether Hand". These individuals are able to reach through time and space itself to summon powerful entities, spells, weapons, and more. 

These Wielders of the Aether Hand have become the de facto rulers of the world. Some are benevolent, while others are driven by greed and a lust for power.

You, the player, bear the blessing (or burden) of the Aether Hand. As a Wielder, you must master your power, and strengthen yourself by collecting Aether Fragments (cards).

## General Idea:

Choose / create a custom Hero card.
Collect cards to form a deck which serve as their Hero's arsenal.
Use these decks to engage in duels against other Heroes.

## Duel Basics:

At the beginning of a duel the player and their opponent start with their Hero card on the field.
First turn is decided by a roll of the dice, unless otherwise specified.

The goal is to reduce the enemy Hero's health to zero.

Each turn you have a limited amount of Action Points, which can be spent to play most types of cards.

Some cards will have an Action Point cost of zero, but require other conditions be met in order to play them.

The amount of Action Points is equivalent to the number of the current turn. 
So for example, on turn 1 the player has 1 Action Point. On turn 10 the player has 10 Action Points.
