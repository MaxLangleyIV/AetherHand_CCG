4. A card can only be played if its Action Point cost is met.
5. Cards may have additional requirements to play.
6. A card with an Action Point cost of 0 must have additional requirements.
7. A card with no listed Action Point cost is treated as a cost of 0.
8. Cards have a Priority Rating from 1 - 4, with 4 having the most priority.
	   When cards are activated in response to a player's action, the actions will be executed in order of highest to lowest priority.
